      <h2>What is New Media Art?</h2>
      <h5>February 4, 2020</h5>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/MAJA1.jpg">
      <p></p>
      <p>Since the 1990s, the world has witness the rapid development of connection between technology and arts. Along with that, artists around the world also started practicing with new technologies and tools such as Internet, Robot, 3D, virtual reality ... that this technology era has been giving them. After a period of early development of the art world, artworks and artists of this type have been accepted by the public, museums and institutions as a hybrid of art and technology. Academics and critics temporarily refer to this art form as New Media Arts.

	  <P>As an multimedia artist, with experimental practice with videos and photography for several years. I love to create arts by drawing something on landscape photographs to make it look unreal capture. I usually use photoshop to draw clouds or eclipse on the landscape to create mysteries. I got inspired a lot by many new media artists on social media. 

	  <p>Maja Petric is one of the popular new media artists. She is an artist creating interactive light installations and sculptures that evoke the beauty of nature. She combines light, sound and technologies to create her own art pieces. For example, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to expand the multi-sensory apparatus through which art can be experienced.</p>
